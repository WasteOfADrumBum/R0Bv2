      <p>
        CRUD is an acronym that comes from the world of computer programming and
        refers to the four functions that are considered necessary to implement
        a persistent storage application: create, read, update and delete.
        Persistent storage refers to any data storage device that retains power
        after the device is powered off, such as a hard disk or a solid-state
        drive. In contrast, random access memory and internal caching are two
        examples of volatile memory - they contain data that will be erased when
        they lose power.
